<h1>Homework 1: Welcome to Python</h1>

<p>
<b>Due: Thursday, 10/3, 11:59pm</b>
via GitHub. Come to lab on Thursday to learn how to submit your assignments
using GitHub.
</p>

<p>
This assignment will familiarize you with the Python programming language.
Python is an easy-to-use but powerful programming language that is
particularly well-suited to quickly creating small programs.
</p>

<p>
Python, and this class, can be done either using a command-line shell
and a text editor, or using graphical environments. Instructions for
both will be provided below. Although the command-line interface is
harder to learn, it will give experts greater power, flexibility, and
speed in performing programming tasks in the future.
</p>

<h1 id="part-i">Part I:  Get started with Python</h1>

<p>
If you need to install Python on your own machine or figure out how to use it on campus,
see <a href="python.html">Using and Installing Python</a>.
</p>

<p>
Read (and follow along with!)
<a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/">a short tutorial for IDLE</a>.
</p>

<!-- <p>
Optionally, follow the first parts of
<a href="http://cscircles.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/">a Python tutorial</a>.
</p>
-->

<!-- I'm not thrilled with this other tutorial: http://www.learnpython.org/ -->

<!--
Don't advertise this Python tutorial, which is for Python 3:
http://centurion2.com/Python/PythonIntro.html
(Ignore the "Installation" parts, which do not use the
Enthought Python Distribution.)
-->

<p>
There is nothing to turn in for Part I of the assignment.
</p>



<h1 id="part-ii">Part II:  Programming exercises</h1>

<p>
Download the file <a href="hw1.py"><tt>hw1.py</tt></a>.
</p>

<p>
For problems in this homework, you will edit your local copy of the
<tt>hw1.py</tt> file.
You may do your work by editing and running <tt>hw1.py</tt> (we recommend
this approach), or by typing code at the Python interpreter (or in an
IDLE window) and copying it into
the appropriate part of <tt>hw1.py</tt> when you are satisfied with it.
When you have completed this homework, running the <tt>hw1.py</tt> file
should compute and print the answers to all the problems.
</p>

<p>
Don't forget to include documentation (source code comments, on a line
starting with <tt>#</tt>) as appropriate in file <tt>hw1.py</tt>.
</p>


<h2>Problem 1: Roots</h2>

<!--
<p>
Compute the larger root of the quadratic equation
13 x<sup>2</sup>+78x-5083.
</p>
-->

<p>
Compute and print both roots of the quadratic equation
x<sup>2</sup>-5.86 x+ 8.5408.
</p>

<p>
Hint: recall that the roots of a quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c are x=
</p>
<table style="font-family:verdana;">
  <tbody><tr>
    <td>−b ± 
    √<span style="text-decoration:overline"> 
    b<span style="font-size: 10px;vertical-align:+25%;">2</span> − 
    4ac&nbsp;</span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align:center;">
    <span style="text-decoration:overline;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
    2a &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
Hint: use the
<a href="http://docs.python.org/library/math.html#math.sqrt"><tt>math.sqrt</tt></a>
function to compute the square root.  (If you are using the Python
interpreter, you need to first do <tt>import math</tt>.  This already
appears in the <tt>hw1.py</tt> file that you will be editing, so everything
is already set up for you if you are working within that file.)
</p>


<h2>Problem 2: Reciprocals</h2>

<p>
Use a <tt>for</tt> loop to print the decimal representations of 1/2, 1/3,
..., 1/10, one on each line.
</p>


<h2>Problem 3: Triangular numbers</h2>

<p>
Use a <tt>for</tt> loop to compute the 10th triangular number.
The <em>n</em>th triangular number is defined as 1+2+3+...+<em>n</em>.
(You can also compute the <em>n</em>th triangular number as <em>n</em>*(<em>n</em>+1)/2.  Use this
formula to double-check that your loop is correct.)
</p>

<p>Hint:
This outline is an almost-complete solution.  You only have to
replace each ellipsis by an expression.
</p>

<pre>n = 10
triangular = 0
for i in ...:
    triangular = ...
print "Triangular number", n, "via loop:", triangular
print "Triangular number", n, "via formula:", n*(n+1)/2
</pre>

<p>
Your solution must not mention the number 10, except in the <tt>n = 10</tt>
line.  Your solution can use <tt>n</tt>, but not <tt>10</tt>.  In other
words, your code (after the <tt>n = 10</tt> line)
should work for any value of <tt>n</tt>.
</p>


<!--
<p>
Bigger hint: First, write your solution as an explicit sum:
</p>
<pre>
  triangular=1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10
  print triangular
</pre>
<p>
Then, convert that formula into an initialization statement and 10 sums.
</p>
<pre>
  triangular=0
  # ... 10 lines of code here, each of which contains one addition operation
  print triangular
</pre>
<p>
Finally, convert the 10 lines of code into a <tt>for</tt> loop.
</p>
-->


<h2 id="factorial">Problem 4: Factorial</h2>

<p>
Use a <tt>for</tt> loop to compute 10!, the factorial of 10.  Recall that
the factorial of n is 1*2*3*...*n.
</p>

<p>
The first line of your solution will be <tt>n = 10</tt>.  After that, your
solution should not use <tt>10</tt> again, though your solution will use
<tt>n</tt>.  In other words, your code (after the <tt>n = 10</tt> line)
should work for any value of <tt>n</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Hint: Your answer will be similar to your answer to "Problem 3:
Triangular numbers".
</p>


<h2>Problem 5: Multiple factorials</h2>

<p>
Write code to print the first 10 factorials, in reverse order.  In
other words, write code that prints 10!, then prints 9!, then prints 8!,
..., then prints 1!.  Its literal output will be:
</p>
<pre>3628800
362880
40320
5040
720
120
24
6
2
1
</pre>

<p>
The first line of your solution should assign a variable <tt>numlines</tt>
to <tt>10</tt>, and then the rest of your solution must not use <tt>10</tt>
anywhere.
</p>

<p>
Hint:  Use two nested <tt>for</tt> loops.<br>
The outer loop sets the value of <tt>n</tt>
to the values <tt>numlines</tt>, <tt>numlines-1</tt>, <tt>numlines-2</tt>, ..., <tt>1</tt>, in succession.<br>
Then, the body of that loop
is itself a loop — exactly your solution to <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse140/13wi/homework/hw1/hw1.html#factorial">"Problem 4: Factorial"</a>,
without the first line <tt>n = 10</tt> that hard-codes the value of <tt>n</tt>.
</p>


<h2>Problem 6: Sums of reciprocals of factorials</h2>

<p>
Compute the following value:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ... + 1/10!<br>
The value should be close to <em>e</em> (≈ 2.71828), the base of the natural logarithms.
</p>

<p>
Hint:  The easiest way to solve this is with two nested <tt>for</tt> loops.
It is possible, but tricky, to compute this using only one for loop.
That is not necessary for this assignment.
</p>

<p>
Hint:  Copy your solution to "Problem 5: Multiple factorials", then modify
it.  Rather than printing the factorials, you will add their
reciprocals to a running total, then print that total at the end.
</p>

<p>
Hint: don't try to work the very first "1 +" into your loop; do it outside
the loops (either at the very beginning or the very end of the outer loop).
</p>


<h2 id="submit">Submit your work</h2>

<p>
You are almost done!
</p>

<p>
Double-check that running your entire file
produces output for each problem in the assignment, and that you have
commented out any extraneous output (which you may have used for debugging,
for example).
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of your <tt>hw1.py</tt> file, state which students or
other people (besides the course staff) helped you with the assignment, or
that no one did.
</p>

<p>
At the bottom of your <tt>hw1.py</tt> file, in the "Reflection" part, state
what you or the staff could have done to help you with the assignment.
