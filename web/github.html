<h1>Git, GitHub, and Turning in your programming homework</h1>

<!-- end toc -->

<p>
In this thread, you will learn about social coding and the version control system
called <code>git</code>, which is the software behind the website <code>github.com</code>.
Version control systems are the primary way that all programmers, both professional
and amateur, keep track of their software, compare the different versions over time,
and share code with one another. It is how future employers or research collaborators
will evaluate your coding ability, and it's probably also how you will choose to
share your code with the world.
</p>

<p>
If you already know about git and just want to submit your homework,
skip to the bottom of the page.
</p>

<p>
Here is a
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">tutorial
to learn about the basics of <code>git</code> and
control</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are two ways to use <code>git</code> and GitHub, using the command-line
interace (git only) which is good for experts,
or using the graphical interface for GitHub, which is good for beginners.
We describe both ways below. Both ways are completely acceptable
for this class.
</p>

<p>
We will discuss all of these options below.
</p>

<h2>Explore GitHub</h2>

<p>
First of all, explore GitHub! Many open source software projects that are
behind websites that you use every day are hosted on GitHub.
Go to <code>http://github.com/explore</code> and look through the most
popular.
If you know someone, perhaps a classmate in CSF, who has a github account,
ask them for their username and ask them if you can look at their
code. For example, my GitHub username is <code>phamp</code> and you can
view all of my public repositories here:
<a href="http://github.com/ppham">http://github.com/ppham</a>.
</p>

<p>
Many famous programmers code on github, such as Linus Torvalds, the creator of
Linux and git itself, or Guido van Rossum, the inventor of Python.
Try googling for "Linus Torvalds github" or "Guido van Rossum github".
</p>

<h2>
GitHub Accounts
</h2>

<p>
Every student in this thread will need their own GitHub account in order to
submit homework. We created these accounts in lecture on ChromeBooks.
Please remember your GitHub account name (which may be different from
your Evergreen login ID) and your GitHub password. You should also have
created a <code>git</code> repository and added the instructor
(username <code>ppham</code>) as a collaborator. If you didn't get a chance
to do this in lecture, e-mail me or come to lab on Thursday
[10/3].
</p>

<h2>
Installation
</h2>

<p>
You will need to follow the instructions below if you would like
to use Git and GitHub on your own computer. If you login into
<code>ada.evergreen.edu</code> remotely, then you can use the
command-line version of <code>git</code>, which is already
installed.
</p>

<h3>
Installing Graphical Version of GitHub
</h3>

<p>
Follow the appropriate link below to install the graphical version of GitHub for your
operating system. If you're using Linux, there is no graphical client. But, you're
using Linux, so what did you expect? :]
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://windows.github.com/help.html">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mac.github.com/help.html">Mac</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>
Installating the Command-Line Version (Git only)
</h3>

<p>
To install git on your own computer, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git">follow these instructions</a>.
Be sure to choose your appropriate operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) at the top of the page.
</p>

<img src="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s73/sh/00aaf881-808f-4897-9a57-31afb30b5cbd/4027a405a02d140f13c873be4a8c9d80/res/31ba7fa1-ec6b-465f-bd52-92f01f7f5cde/skitch.png?resizeSmall&width=832" />

<p>
For experts, follow the links in blue circles, and then read the entire page.
The links also contain a tutorial in using <code>git</code> from the command-line,
in case you are completely new to git. We will be covering this in lab as well.
You can follow the instructions for password caching, so you don't have to re-type in
your password every time you use git. You can also use the old method,
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys">SSH key forwarding</a>, which is what I do.
</p>


<h2>
Using <code>git</code> and GitHub
</h2>

<h3>Using the Graphical Version of GitHub</h3>

<p>
We will be covering the basics of working
with github repositories in class. You can
view online tutorials for the graphical versions
below.
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://windows.github.com/help.html">Windows Graphical Help</a></li>
<li><a href="http://mac.github.com/help.html">Mac Graphical Help</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Using the Command-Line Version of git</h3>

<p>
If you are using the command-line version of <code>git</code>,
on your own Linux machine or on <code>ada.evergreen.edu</code>,
you should follow <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/create-a-repo">
these instructions for setting up your
GitHub repository</a>.
</p>

<p>
Then you can follow this <a href="http://try.github.io/">really cool <code>git</code> tutorial</a>.
</p>

<h2>To submit homework</h2>

<p>
You will submit homework by

<ol>
<li>adding and committing all the
necessary files on your computer that are related to the homework
</li>
<li>
creating tags with
a name like <code>hwx</code> (for example, <code>hw1</code> for submitting
Homework 1,)
</li>
<li>
pushing the tag (and the master branch) to your github repository.
</li>
</ol>

You must do all of these steps before the homework deadline,
or it will be counted as late. Late homework will still be
accepted, but it will affect your course evaluation.
