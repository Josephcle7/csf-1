<h1>Installing and Using Python at Evergreen</h1>

<!-- end toc -->

<p>
You can install Python on your own machine (laptop or desktop computer) if you prefer to work at home.
Or you can use Python on college computers provided in the ACC (Academic Computing Center).
</p>

<p>
There are also two ways of using Python: using a graphical integrated development
environment which is more friendly to beginners, and a command-line way which is
more powerful for experienced users.
</p>

<p>
We will discuss all of these options below.
</p>

<h2 id="Installing_Python">Installing Python</h2>

<p>
Python is free and open-source, and is easy to install on Windows, Mac, and
Linux platforms.  We will use a free distribution of Python that is graciously
provided by Enthought Scientific Computing Solutions, called
<a href="https://www.enthought.com/downloads/">Canopy Express, which you can download here.</a>
If your operating system doesn't show up automatically, click on the links
at the bottom of the screen.
</p>

<p>
If you have problems, please e-mail the instructor.
Canopy Express is currently not available on ACC machines, although we are working to change that.
</p>

<p>The Canopy Express installer will ask you if you wish to use its
version of Python on the command-line, and say something about
adding directories to your path. Unless you already have some other
Python distribution installed and you truly love it and have tons of
custom packages for it, etc., it is probably safe to say "Yes" and
let Canopy do its thing.
</p>

<h2 id="Graphical">Using Python from IDLE</h2>

<p>
For beginning users, it is easier to use a graphical
environment than the command-line. A graphical
environment that lets you edit, run, navigate, and debug Python files
is called an integrated development environment (IDE) because it
integrates all the different parts of programming into one
piece of software.
</p>

<p>
A popular IDE available for Windows, Mac,
and Linux machines is called IDLE.
IDLE is installed as part of the Enthought Canopy Express
distribution installed (see above) or the standard
Python distribution (from http://python.org).
You can access this on all Mac machines in the ACC.
</p>

<p>
Here is a tutorial on using IDLE for beginners from
UC Berkeley:
<a href="https://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/">
One Day of IDLE Toying</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="IDLE">Using Python Graphically</h2>

<p>
If you are using Windows, you may prefer to use the IDLE, which
comes with the standard Python distribution that you can download from http://python.org.
IDLE is more than just an editor; it is a simple but powerful IDE, or
"integrated development environment", which lets you edit, run, navigate,
and debug Python code.
</p>




<h2 id="Command_Shell">Using Python from the Command Line and Text Editor</h2>

<p>
Using Python from the command-line lets expert users accomplish
a wider variety of programming tasks, and lets them do it more efficiently,
then using a graphical interface. However, it is optional and not
necessary for this class.
</p>

<p>
Python is installed by default on the command-line in both Mac OS X and Linux,
including Mac and Linux machines in the ACC. If you prefer to run your
Python programs from the command-line in these operating systems, no
installation is necessary. Instead, simply type <code>python</code>
at your command prompt to get similar output to the excerpt below:
</p>

<blockquote><code>
$ python
Python 2.7.2 (default, Oct 11 2012, 20:14:37) 
[GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple Clang 4.0 (tags/Apple/clang-418.0.60)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
</code></blockquote>

<p>
This runs Python in interactive mode. If you wish to run a script/program,
for example called <code>myprogram.py</code>,
enter <code>python myprogram.py</code> at the prompt instead.
For more information about invoking the Python interpreter from the
command-line, see this page in the official Python tutorial:
<a href="http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/interpreter.html">
Using the Python Interpreter</a>.
</p>

<p>
For more about UNIX commands, the UNIX shell, and working with files and directories,
see the document <a href="http://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse140/13wi/shell-usage.html">How do I use the command-line
    shell?</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can also get a command-line interface on Windows by using
<a href="http://cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>, which is really useful for emulating
all kinds of UNIX-style development on a Windows machine.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you can get a command-line interface anywhere by
logging into the server <code>ada.evergreen.edu</code>
using a Secure Shell (ssh) and using the Linux command-line
remotely. ssh itself is available from Mac and Linux
on their own command-lines. A popular SSH client for
Windows is called <a href="http://www.putty.org/">PutTy</a>.

<p>
However, the commands above only execute Python once you've already written
a program. In order to write the program, you will need to use a
separate text editor. Many good alternatives exist. On Linux, the
usual favorite is<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">emacs</a>
or <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, although ports of these
exist for Mac and Windows as well.
On Mac, <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a>
is a good free
version. My personal preference is <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a>, which runs on both Mac and
Linux. It is available for free, but it will nag you for a donation every
so often when you try to save a file.
</p>

<h2 id="Mac_Linux">Built-in Python on Mac and Linux</h2>

<p>
Mac and Linux users already have Python (2.x) installed, and you can use
those for simple programs. However, when we start using the libraries
<code>numpy</code>, <code>scipy</code>, and <code>matplotlib</code>,
among others, you will have to install these manually using whatever
package manager you prefer. If this sounds like too much trouble to you,
or you don't know what a package manager is, we recommend you just use
the Canopy Express distribution above from Enthought.
</p>

<h2 id="2vs3">Python 3 versus Python 2</h2>

<p>
We will be using Python 2 for the rest of the quarter, although
the differences with Python 3 will be mostly unnoticeable.
Many important libraries for scientific computing and plotting
data (making pretty pictures) still use Python 2, and so we will, too.
For more details about the differences between Python 2 and 3,
see this document: <a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3">Python 2 or Python 3?</a>.
